# Costs control
Java Enterprise project with registration/authorization and role-based interface (USER, ADMIN). The administrator can create/edit/delete users, and users can manage their profile and data (day, costs) via UI (by AJAX) and via REST interface with basic authorization. It is possible to filter data by dates and times, while the color of the costs table entry depends on whether it exceeds sum costs per day rate (editable parameter in the user profile). The entire REST interface is covered by JUnit tests using Spring MVC Test and Spring Security Test.
This Java web application uses multitier architecture.
